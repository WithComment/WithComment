I am a secondary school student, originally from Beijing, China, currently studying in Wellington, New Zealand.

I don't really have a specialty as I've been programming for only two years.

I have completed CS50x and CS50w and I loved them. Right now I am doing CS50 AI. Hopefully by the end of this year I will have a clearer picture of what I'd like to study further.
