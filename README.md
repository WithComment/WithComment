# Hi there, I'm Xiaowen

I am a **Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Toronto** specializing in Machine Learning Research. My work currently focuses on LLM inference time optimization by improving reasoning effectiveness.

---

### Research Focus
* **Mechanistic Interpretability:** Investigating internal circuits in Pythia models to understand how pretraining artifacts influence downstream finetuning efficiency.
* **Test-time Scaling:** Developing search-based planning methods (MCTS) and verification signals to improve model reasoning without retraining.
* **Efficient Post-training:** Adapted Hierarchical RL for LLM reasoning using **GRPO** and custom reward function.

### Technical Stack
* **Core:** Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace (Transformers, PEFT, TRL)
* **Infrastructure:** vLLM, DeepSpeed, Slurm, Linux/Bash, Git.
* **Systems/Web:** Java, C, SQL (PostgreSQL), Django.

### Key Projects
* **Contextual Finetuning:** Scaled training for 3B–14B parameter models on high-performance clusters using DeepSpeed and torchrun.
* **NC Daily Notices Service:** A production-grade scraping and notification service serving 800+ daily users since 2020 via Django and Heroku.
